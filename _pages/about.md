I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, College Park, working on applications of machine learning and natural language processing in computational social science. My research focuses on natural language understanding (NLU) and commonsense reasoning.

I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Rachel Rudinger](https://rudinger.github.io/).

## Research Interests
My work explores:
- **Cultural Commonsense Knowledge**: Understanding how cultural context shapes language understanding
- **Bias in Large Language Models**: Investigating fairness in AI systems, particularly in hiring decisions
- **NLP for Social Good**: Applying NLP techniques to address societal challenges

## Recent Work
I'm currently working on understanding cultural differences in commonsense reasoning and examining potential biases in large language models used for decision-making.

## News
- **[2024]** New preprint on LLM discrimination in hiring decisions
- **[2024]** Paper accepted at EMNLP on cultural commonsense knowledge
